I am a PhD candidate in Materials Engineering at Purdue University, working under the guidance of Prof. Alejandro Strachan and Prof. Arun Mannodi. My research focuses on leveraging machine learning and atomistic simulations to accelerate materials discovery, with particular emphasis on perovskite materials and defect modeling.

## Research Focus

My work spans several exciting areas in computational materials science:

- **Machine Learning for Materials Discovery**: Developing graph neural networks and active learning pipelines to predict material properties and optimize device performance
- **Perovskite Materials**: Creating FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) databases for perovskite materials and using them to predict synthesizability
- **Defect Modeling**: Performing high-fidelity point defect calculations to understand carrier properties and dopability in photovoltaic materials like BaZrSâ‚ƒ
- **High-throughput Screening**: Building automated workflows for materials property prediction and device optimization

## Technical Expertise

I have extensive experience in:
- **Computational Methods**: Density Functional Theory (DFT), Molecular Dynamics, Machine Learning
- **Programming**: Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, High-Performance Computing
- **Software**: VASP, Quantum Espresso, LAMMPS, COMSOL
- **Experimental Techniques**: XRD, Optical Spectroscopy, SEM, Thin Film Processing

## Open Source Contributions

I actively contribute to the materials science community through open-source tools on nanoHUB. You can explore my contributions [here](https://nanohub.org/members/410425/contributions), including tools for perovskite database curation and automated workflow management.

## Publications & Recognition

I have published several papers in top-tier journals including *Journal of Physical Chemistry C* and *Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics*. My work has been recognized with awards such as the Best Poster Presentation at the Materials Research Data Alliance (MaRDA) Annual Meeting in 2024.

## Looking Forward

I am passionate about applying machine learning and computational methods to solve real-world materials challenges. I'm particularly interested in internships and collaborations in applied ML for novel energy devices and materials optimization.
